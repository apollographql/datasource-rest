Update default `cacheKeyFor` to include method

In its previous form, `cacheKeyFor` only used the URL to calculate the cache key. As a result, when `cacheOptions.ttl` was specified, the method was ignored. This could lead to surprising behavior where a POST request's response was cached and returned for a GET request (for example).

The default `cacheKeyFor` now includes the request method, meaning there will now be distinct cache entries for a given URL per method.
